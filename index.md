Hello and welcome! As you've probably already learned, I am Adam Al-Attrach. Born and raised in MontrÃ©al, Canada, I am currently a U3 Computer Science Student at McGill. I am always looking for chance to develop my abilities as a programmer, don't be shy to [contact me](mailto:adamalattrach@gmail.com) with any opportunity. My spare time is used to game, wrestle and [code](https://github.com/AdamAlAttrach){:target="_blank"} some more.

Here is my [resume](./assets/CSCVv9.pdf){:target="_blank"}! <br>
You can find a little overview of my projects right over [here](./_featured_categories/projects.md)
